I created this PWA app as a Avalanche Canada clone while learning Nextjs 14, React 18, NextUI, Redux Toolkit.

Uses Avalanche Canada's public api: https://docs.avalanche.ca/


Features
- displays avalanche areas with a random colour layer
- clicking on an area auto pans to the area bbox and auto scrolls to the correct description card
- pressing the locate button on the area description card auto pans to the area



<br>
deployed as a pwa to aws amplify: https://main.dvqwms1hblhmk.amplifyapp.com/
<br>
<br>
<br>br>
<br>
TO DO
- improve mobile view 
- get pwa mobile install working properly
- colour code ratings and area shading
- refactor to react / redux / nextjs best practices
